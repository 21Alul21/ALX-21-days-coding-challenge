# ALX 21 days coding challenge
ALX students 21 days of C challenges based on Sams teach yourself C in 21 days book, a PDF version can be found in this repo.

These challenges are 100% voluntary and for those who wish to improve on their C programming skills. You may come up with the solutions alone or with the help of external persons and tools.

### How to contribute / participate in the challenge

1. Fork the main repo from [ALX-21-days-coding-challenge](https://github.com/dutkulang/ALX-21-days-coding-challenge)

2. clone your forked copy of the repo.

3. create your own development branch after your own name

```sh
# An example could be that my name is Betty Kimba

# git branch <your-name>

$ git branch betty-kimba
```
4. Switch to your created branch.

```sh
$ git switch betty-kimba
```
5. Create a folder for the challenge of your choice.
```sh
$ mkdir -p Day2_challenge

$ cd Day2_challenge
```
6. create a `notes.md` file(optional) and your solution files

At times as we code, alot of research is done before-hand and during the actual coding process. `notes.md` is the right place to include those findings.

7. Remember to use Betty.
8. Push your working branch to GitHub.

```sh
# git push origin <your-name>
$ git push origin betty-kimba
```
9. Contribute your work to the main repo by creating a pull request.

Give your pull request a title and comment.
```txt

`The zen of ALX, by Dut Kulang`

As you do hard things

Remember that aunty Betty is final

because she is the BOSS

you must make her HAPPY

Your code MUST be to her taste

or suffer in her hands

her pet Kimba will smell and bite

if you dare try to cheat. 

80 hours a week is real not a joke,

datelines willl police and enforce it.

To defer does not make you failure

even the smartest minds must rest too

semi-colons are the root cause of all evil 

don't forget them at end of your lines.

C will make see 

ask Cpython what it saw

while true, we

Do hard things
